		<h1>About us</h1>
		<p>When you hear the name Buckinghamshire Windows Ltd, you may initially think…. ‘Double Glazing’ which is understandable, as that is where it all began; but we also specialise in <a href="conservatories.php">Conservatories</a>, <a href="doors.php">Doors</a> and <a href="roofline-products.php">Roofline Products</a>. All which, we are proud to say, are undertaken to a very high standard.</p>

		<p>At Buckinghamshire Windows Ltd, we take great pride in helping you decide which style of <a href="windows.php">windows and doors</a> would suite your property. Maybe your thinking of a beautiful Conservatory designed to expand your living space and compliment your home. Whatever your requirements, we will bring your dreams to life and be there every step of the way for you, from design to completion. </p>

		<p>We rely on our customer satisfaction for our reputation. We are confident that ‘YOU’ will have an enjoyable and stress- free installation process, enabling you to enjoy your new home improvement. </p>

		<p>We have no need to conduct our business based on ‘High Pressure Sales’ or ‘Sales Gimmicks’. We simply have confidence in our quality products and our experience, along with a professional service at a very competitive price, and what’s more, this is covered with our 10 year insurance backed guarantee.</p>

		<p>All of the products installed by us will be measured professionally by our surveyor prior to manufacture. All products are ‘Bespoke’ to ensure the best possible installation.</p>
