		<h1>Roof Line Products</h1>
		<p>
		When Buckinghamshire Windows Ltd install Roof Line Products, we remove the existing Fascias and Soffits and replace with 18mm Fascias and 10mm Soffit Boards, we ‘DO NOT’ cover the existing with 10mm Cappit Board; leaving the Rotting or Damaged timber underneath.
		We also install Felt-Drip Trays, which are positioned under the roof felt and on top of the new Fascia. This is to stop the roof felt sagging and getting stuck behind the Fascia Board.
		There are also options for ventilation, where you can choose from: Visible SoffitVents, Vented soffits or Over Fascia Vents, which fit to the top of the new Fascia. These vents are important to allow cross ventilation within the roof space.</p>

		
		<h3>All Fascias and Soffits are available in:</h3>
		<p>WHITE, ROSEWOOD, GOLDEN OAK and BLACK.</p>

		<h3>Our Guttering is available in:</h3>
		<p>HALF ROUND, SQUARE LINE, DEEP FLOW and OGEE in WHITE, BLACK or BROWN.</p>
