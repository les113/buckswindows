	<h1>Servicing</h1>
	<p>Should you already have Double Glazed Windows, Doors, a Conservatory or Roof-Line Products and have problems that may not still be under the suppliers guarantee, or the company that supplied them are no longer trading, we can service them for you.</p>
	<p>Buckinghamshire Windows Ltd also offer to undertake service work where we can supply new Sealed Units or replace broken Handles and Door Locks. This can often be a less costly option and some of the time all that is required, rather than a new window or door. We can also replace Conservatory Roof Glass or Polycarbonate roof panels.</p>

	<h3>Please contact us to arrange an appointment for our surveyor to visit and see if we can be of assistance.</h3>
